# Legal Traversal System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate Node IDs** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The source JSON data contains multiple nodes with identical IDs (`part_1`, `part_2`, etc.). This caused:
- Nodes overwriting each other during processing
- Apparent "repeated" nodes in traversal output
- Loss of unique document sections

**Solution**: 
- Added `generateUniqueId()` function in `document-transformer.ts`
- Automatically appends suffixes (`_2`, `_3`, etc.) when duplicate IDs are detected
- Preserves all content whilst ensuring unique node identification

### 2. **Nodes Being Skipped with Zero Scores** ‚ö° IMPROVED  
**Problem**: Many nodes were receiving 0.00 relevance scores and being skipped because:
- Relevance threshold was set too high (0.5)
- AI scoring was being too conservative
- Many genuinely relevant sections were missed

**Solution**:
- Lowered relevance threshold from 0.5 to 0.3 (configurable)
- Added detailed logging for skip reasons
- Enhanced batch evaluation with better context
- Improved scoring summary at each level

### 3. **Traversal Stuck at Root Level** üîç DIAGNOSED
**Problem**: The system was finding nodes but staying at Level 0, not exploring deeper hierarchy.

**Root Cause**: The duplicate ID issue meant the document structure wasn't properly hierarchical - child references were pointing to overwritten nodes.

**Solution**: The unique ID fix should resolve this by maintaining proper parent-child relationships.

## Changes Made

### `lib/utils/document-transformer.ts`
- Added `generateUniqueId()` helper function
- Updated root section processing to use unique IDs
- Updated child node processing to use unique IDs
- Enhanced logging for duplicate detection

### `lib/services/legal-traversal.ts`
- Made relevance threshold configurable (default: 0.3)
- Added detailed skip reason categorisation
- Enhanced logging with level summaries
- Updated all threshold references to use the configurable value

### `app/(preview)/api/traverse/route.ts`
- Updated to use lower relevance threshold (0.3)

## Expected Improvements

1. **No More Duplicate Nodes**: Each node will have a unique ID
2. **Better Content Discovery**: Lower threshold will find more relevant sections
3. **Deeper Traversal**: Fixed hierarchy should allow exploration beyond Level 0
4. **Better Visibility**: Enhanced logging shows exactly why nodes are skipped

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run a test traversal** to verify unique IDs are generated
2. **Check depth progression** - should now explore beyond Level 0
3. **Monitor skip reasons** - should see more variety in reasoning
4. **Verify child exploration** - should add children to queue for processing

## Configuration Options

The traversal system now accepts a configurable relevance threshold:
```typescript
// Lower threshold = more permissive (finds more nodes)
const traversal = new LegalDocumentTraversal(documentTree, 0.2);

// Higher threshold = more strict (finds fewer, higher-confidence nodes)  
const traversal = new LegalDocumentTraversal(documentTree, 0.6);
```

## Monitoring

The enhanced logging will now show:
- Duplicate ID detections with remapping
- Skip reason categorisation (low score vs not visited)
- Level-by-level summaries
- Child exploration details
